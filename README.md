# Floating Label

This is a jQuery module that automatically manages specified labels so that they
may be placed "within" the input when there is no value, or above the input when
there is a value or the input has focus. It is best to use this for labels that
describe textual input types.

## Usage

To use, include jQuery and the Floating Label javascript code, and instantiate similarly:

```js
$('label[for="inputName"]').FloatingLabel();
```
